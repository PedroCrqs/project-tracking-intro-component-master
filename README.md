## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Position Property
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned some things while creating this project. One of these things is the importance of a mobile-first workflow (yes, I didnâ€™t use it) to ensure clean code and proper design. Another key lesson is the correct use of position properties: if you overuse them, the mobile version may not display correctly on all devices. I spent several hours trying to unravel the correct way to use position and overflow properties, and in the end, I discovered that these properties need to be used carefully.
